# MNR_Database
Database Project for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry

The purpose of the project is to redesign the database management system for the Ministry of National Resources and Forestry. Our goal is to bring the system up to current production standards and improve the services offered to the clients.

We are introducing an integration system for the customer portal which will allow for easy form submissions and information input directly into the company's database. This includes the integration of the MFPA registration exam, ensuring that all the necessary information is stored in the database for future reference. We understand the importance of secure data, so we will be implementing Access Level security to ensure the confidentiality of the information stored.

Our team will also be creating a web interface for the ministry staff, allowing them to send queries and modify the database based on their access levels which can be accessed via visiting https://loki.trentu.ca/~mnrf_project/. 

We will be automating a lot of processes which will streamline many of the previously manual and time-consuming procedures, such as form submissions and data collection for the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation.

We are confident that this redesign will bring significant improvements to the database management system and make it more user-friendly and efficient for both the clients and the ministry staff.
